Control Flow is the order in which the program's code executes.
Code executes from top to bottom and left to right.
I can use control statements to control the order in which the program's code executes.
They help my program make decisions.
The control flow of a Python program is regulated by:

conditional statements (if,else,else) are statements that only run based on certain conditions.

loops are used to repeat a specific block of code. (for and while)

    function call
