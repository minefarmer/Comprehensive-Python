'''                 If Statements
Used to check conditions before it executes certain code.
They help my  programs make decisions.
They only run code in if-block when condition is True.
If a condition is not meet, then nothing runs.

Basic syntax
if(condition):
    indented Statement block










'''
a = 7
b = 8

if a < b:
    print(a, "is smaller than", b)  # 7 is smaller than 8

if a > b:
    print(a, "is smaller than", b)  #  (nothing was printed becas)
