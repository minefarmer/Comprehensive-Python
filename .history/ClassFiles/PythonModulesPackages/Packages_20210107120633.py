"""                      What are Python Packages?
Packages are just folders(directories) that contain modules.
They contain a special python file named:__init__.py
The __init__.py file can be empty. The file tells Python that the directory of folder contains a python package which can be imported like a module.
Packages are a convenient way to organize modules.
A package also can contain sub-packages.
