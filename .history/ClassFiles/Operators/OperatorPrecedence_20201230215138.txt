            OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
This determines the order in which operators should be evaluated if there are multiple operators used in a statement or expression.

Operator Precedence     Name    ## Hiest at the top
()                      Parenthesis
**                      Exponent (Power)(Power)
~x                      Bitwise NOT
*, /, //, %             Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulas
+, -                    Addition, subtraction
<<, >>                  Bitwise shift operators
&                       Bitwise AND
^                       Bitwise XOR
|                       Bitwise OR
--, !=, >, >=, <, <=, is, is not, in, not in        Comparisons, Identy, MEMBERSHIP
not                     Logical NOT
and                     Logical AND
or                      Logical OR


Any expression that has a parentheses around it, but a part of the expression will always get evaluated first.


>>> 3 + 4 * 2
11

>>> (3 + 4) * 2
14
