Type of programming that breaks things into objects that interacts with each other.
Objects are created from classes.
Object Oriented Programming encourages code reuse through the D,R.Y. concept.


An object can be an entity or anything in your program like a noun.
Cars, planes are objects.


A class is a blueprint (Template) for ceating objects.
Class can have properties(attributes) which are like variables that store data.
Classes can also have behaviours(methods). These re like functions.
I can create many unique objects from a single class.


Instantiating a class means ceating a new object from a class.
