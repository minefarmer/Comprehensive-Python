'''                 CASTING DATA TYPES
Casting is the process of converting the value of a variable from one data type to another.
This is done using various built-in Python functions.
Int() converts value to an integer (whole number).
Float() converts value to a floating point number.

'''

x = '70'
y = '-20'
print(x + y)  # 70-20

print(int(x) + int(y))  # 50


c = 7
d = 8
print(float(c) + float(d))  # 15.0


e = 9
f = 8.5
print(str(e), "and", str(f), "are strings.")  # 9 and 8.5 are strings.
